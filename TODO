Make a List:
  ^ start your list with value + ` : `
  *Keep the below for examples on how to format till you get good at it*
  *bold* _italic_ ~strikeThrough~ `code` tags:@tag @critical @high @low @today
  You can provide time estimates for your todo's with > @1h30m
  You can even use natural time language with > @est(1 day and 20 minutes)
  KeyBinds are the best! **NOTE need to rebind for Archive Done Todo's!
  Box=`alt+enter` Done=`alt+D` Start=`alt+S ` Cancel=`alt+C`

Test:
  ☐ this is atest
  ☐ make some todo's
